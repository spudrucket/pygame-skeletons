Learning Pygame Attack The Skeleton Game

This is a silly game where the hero must attack the skeleton enemies. The goal is to learn the basics of pygame, so the code is hopefully clearly annotated. I began with the pygame example "Move it!" in version 1.0. For version 2.0 I used the sample code in "Hit the moving Chimp." Version 3.0 adds some animation to the sprites, enemy sprites disappear when attacked, enemy movement is randomized

Arrow keys move the hero and space attacks. Escape quits the program.
