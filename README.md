Learning Pygame Attack The Skeleton Game

This is a silly game where the hero must attack the skeleton enemies. The goal is to learn the basics of pygame, so the code is hopefully clearly annotated. I began with the pygame example "Move it!" in version 1.0. For version 2.0 I used the sample code in "Hit the moving Chimp."
